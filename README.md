DISCLAIMER: 
At Fblthp Foundries, we acknowledge the ethical concerns related to our use of Stable Diffusion 3 and DALL-E for generating AI artwork in our Magic: The Gathering card project. These concerns include potential intellectual property issues and the broader impact on the artistic community.
We recognize the importance of these issues and the need for ongoing discussion within the community about the ethical implications of AI-generated art. The use of AI in creative processes raises complex questions about originality, ownership, and the value of human creativity.
We regret any harm caused and remain committed to considering these important ethical considerations in our work. We hope that through dialogue and awareness, we can contribute to a more thoughtful and responsible approach to AI-generated art.
