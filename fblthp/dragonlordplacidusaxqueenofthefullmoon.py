    Please provide a detailed description for an image that captures the essence of this card. Avoid text in the image. 
    If there are named characters from MTG in the name, oracle text, or flavor text, do your best to incorporate them into the art.
    Simply explain what to generate.
    Avoid using the words "token" and "card" in the prompt. Avoid urban environments, unless they are somewhat fantasy in nature.
    Return ONLY the prompt as a response. The prompt should be summarized in 150 tokens.

Create a unique card within the world of Magic: The Gathering, ensuring it follows the game's official rules. This card should have a diverse set of characteristics, including a randomly chosen color identity, mana cost, and type with appropriate subtypes.

- Choose a random color identity and design a mana cost that reflects it, with colorless cost appearing before colored cost.
- Select a random type and subtype, making sure it fits within a themed and cohesive narrative.
- Ensure that this card could seamlessly integrate into a well-rounded strategy, with a power level that complements the broader game.
- Return ONLY a JSON dictionary with 'type_line', 'name', 'mana_cost', 'oracle_text', 'flavor_text', 'power', 'toughness', and 'loyalty' fields, with string values.
- If a field is not applicable, set it to an empty string.
- Format mana symbols with angle brackets, e.g., <G>.
- Focus on thematic elements and do not explicitly mention "cards" or "tokens".
- Generate only one entity per API call.
