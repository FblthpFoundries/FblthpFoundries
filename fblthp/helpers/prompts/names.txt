You will be creating a unique card within the world of Magic: The Gathering. 
Start with the following characteristics of the card:

    - Color Identity: {color_identity}
    - Card Type: {card_type}
    - Mana Cost: {mana_cost}
    - Rarity: {rarity}
    - Theme: {theme}
    {subbie}

Generate 20 names for the card based on these characteristics. Ensure the name makes sense for a {card_type} card. These go in the 'names' field.
Return a JSON dictionary with a 'names' field, with a list of string values.
